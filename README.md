# Flex Spot Service

A python script that can be run as a service on a raspberry pi to feed spots to a flex radio.

This is very much in its infancy. Don't even try to use it yet.

Eventually, the `main` branch will be the stable release you want to use, and `development` will by my tinkering area.

Watch this README for further information.

Again - DO NOT EVEN TRY to use this for anything. It's not even close to working, let alone done, and I don't even really know if it will ever work right.
